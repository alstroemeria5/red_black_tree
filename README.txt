This project incorporates e4c exception handling to mimic c++ behavior since the projects use some sort of oop designed paradigmn while using
C as implementing laguage. At the same time,this project links with bdwgc to have garbage collector functionality but the author currently has 
little idea about what's the underhood of bdwgc so usage of this library limits only to GC_MALLOC and GC_FREE and not differs from malloc and
free in standard library.
This is a learning project for the author to practice in generic type in C using red_black tree as practicing topic.
